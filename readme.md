# Breathing Relaxer App

A web app that helps you breathe and relax.


I learned to make this app through this lesson: [Breathe & Relax App | Traversy Media](https://youtu.be/l-1ZrU6avzI) (lesson source code: [vanillawebprojects/relaxer-app](https://github.com/bradtraversy/vanillawebprojects/tree/master/relaxer-app))



I chose to do the scaling animation entirely in CSS, instead of using JS to alter the `container` class and animate accordingly. 



The lesson source code did not include a license, so neither did I.
